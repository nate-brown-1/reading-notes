## Thoughts on text editors

- Code can be written in a text editor with no features (Notepad)
- Just because it can, doesn't mean it should
- Text editors with more features can make reading code easier and reduce errors/typos

### 3 Classifications of text editors

1. No features (Notepad)
2. Advanced text editor
   - broad range of feature sets
   - from lightweight but has some features (vim)
   - to fully featured (VSCode)
3. IDE (integrated design environment) includes source code editor/advanced text editor together with other development tools (debugger, version control, compiler for some languages, etc)

### Factors to consider when choosing a text editor

1. Code Completion
   - Like MS Word autocomplete, or Gmail predictive text, but for code
   - Can sometimes finish brackets, close HTML tags, etc
2. Emmet Shorthand support
   - Saves time when writing HTML/CSS
3. Syntax Highlighting
   - Recognizes components of code and shows them in different colored text
   - Elements, attributes, comments, variables all look different
   - Code with errors/typos won't show the right color, helpful when looking for problematic sections
4. Themes
   - Light/dark modes
   - Change appearance to user preference/environment
5. Extensions
   - Add features to your text editor

### Which of these are seem important to me?

- Of these, ***Syntax Highlighting*** looks magical
- ***Code Completion*** has potential if it works better than the predictive text I'm familiar with
- I'm sure I will need *Extensions* and *Emmet* later
- I don't care about richly featured **Themes** besides having dark mode available

## Command cheat sheet

I found this Mac terminal guide at iFixit (I also enjoy their picture tutorials of "non-serviceable" Apple device teardowns!)
