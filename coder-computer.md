## Thoughts on text editors

- Code can be written in a text editor with no features (Notepad)
- Just because it can, doesn't mean it should
- Text editors with more features can make reading code easier and reduce errors/typos

### Factors to consider when choosing a text editor

1. Code Completion
   - Like MS Word autocomplete, or Gmail predictive text, but for code
   - Can sometimes finish brackets, close HTML tags, etc 
2. Emmet Shorthand support
   - Saves time when writing HTML/CSS
3. Syntax Highlighting
   - Recognizes components of code and shows them in different colored text
   - Elements, attributes, comments, variables all look different
   - Code with errors/typos won't show the right color, helpful when looking for problematic sections
4. Themes
   - Light/dark modes
   - Change appearance to user preference/environment

### Which of these are important to me?

- ***Syntax Highlighting*** looks magical
- ***Code Completion*** definitely useful
- *Themes* standard dark mode is fine, more than that seems whatever
- **Emmet** I don't know enough to have an opinion
