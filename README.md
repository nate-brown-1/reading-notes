## Code Fellows 102 Reading Notes

### Explain a growth mindset in your own words

I would define a growth mindset as a belief that a person is capable of expanding their intellect, skills, and abilities, and is both willing to and interested in taking the necessary steps to effect this expansion. The growth mindset recognizes that change is constant and that every experience is a learning opportunity from which some positive takeaway can be found. It seeks out new experiences and challenges rather than accepting the status quo.

#### 3 ways to maintain the growth mindset

1. Set defined, achievable goals that have meaningful checkpoints in order to maintain progress.

2. Seek out people who demonstrate a growth mindset of their own. Don't imitate them, but use your understanding of what works for them to shape your own. This can come from people you know, people you know of, people in history, or even characters in media.

3. Don't be afraid of detours, but don't go so far into rabbit holes that you lose sight of the big picture.
