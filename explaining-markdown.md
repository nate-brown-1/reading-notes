# Transcript of Friday's discussion with N.T.F.

Markdown is a tool to generate web pages by writing them in a form of shorthand or "syntax".

> Ok, so what is it good for?

Markdown allows the writer to focus on the content of the pages rather than on the time-consuming and technical process of writing them in HTML.

> What's HTML?

HTML is the language of web pages. After a creator produces a page using Markdown, GitHub converts the Markdown syntax into HTML that can be read by any web browser application.

> So it can be used to create fully featured web pages?

Not exactly. The Markdown syntax is not intended as a replacement for HTML and its feature set is intentionally limited. It's best for pages that only require text and simple images, kind of like the the pages you remember from growing up in the 1990s.

> Yes, I remember those. Now how do I create a page with it?

In your GitHub repository, click the button for "Add file" and select "Create new file". This will immediately send you to a page with a large text box and a field to enter the file's name.

> How does GitHub know that I'm going to use Markdown?

When you name the file, it's important to include the extension `.md` at the end of the file name. This extension indicates to GitHub that it needs to read the text box as Markdown so it can be converted to HTML later. If you write a bunch of Markdown in the box but don't include the `.md` extension, GitHub reads it all as plain text.
